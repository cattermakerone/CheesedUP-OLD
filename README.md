# Pizza Tower: Cheesed Up!
Another one of Loypoll's Pizza Tower mods. This one is still currently in active development but has moved to a newer codebase. This is the old codebase. This also has had its source code leaked, so I'll keep the repository public.
# Dependencies
* The modified `.bank` files. The game works without them, but it'll have no audio.
# NOTE
Note that this is a reupload of the "Old" Cheesed Up from loypoll's repo.
